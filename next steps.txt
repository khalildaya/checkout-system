rules engine
- conflict resolution function

some graphQl treatment
log requests and errors
linting
check passed rule type matches rule type assert function
add returns for first rule processor
make rule processor prefix as env variable
opt out of offers to avoid "negative item quantity"

rule engine: assert for first two rule types is the same,
maybe that type should have been abstracted
